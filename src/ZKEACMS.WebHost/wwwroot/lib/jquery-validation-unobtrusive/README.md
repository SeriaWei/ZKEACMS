jQuery Unobtrusive Validation
=============================

The jQuery Unobtrusive Validation library complements jQuery Validation by adding support for specifying validation options as HTML5 `data-*` elements.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

Remember to make your changes to only the src file. Use ".\build.cmd" to automatically generate the js file in dist directory, minify the js file, create a .nupkg and change the version in the package.json if needed.

To stage for a release, update the "version.props" file and run ".\build.cmd" (see Release Checklist [here](https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/wiki/Release-checklist)).
